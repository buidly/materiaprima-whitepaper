### Spawning time
Bosses are only available during a certain time period. They spawn every Thursday at 18:00 CET and remain available until 06:00 am Tuesday morning, or until defeated.

### Fight System
Despite the distinct rivalries and differences among alchemists and the various factions within the alchemists' guild, the open world boss event necessitates a united front from all alchemists. These boss enemies possess such immense HP that it is virtually impossible for a single player to defeat them during their active period. Collaborative effort and strategic coordination among all alchemists are essential to bring down these enemies.  
Successful defeat of the boss between Thursday evening and Tuesday morning rewards players with valuable loot, incentivizing teamwork and cooperation. 

Loot is only awarded if the boss is defeated, so it's vital to inform the community and rally everyone for a unified effort.


The boss fight in Materia Prima shares some mechanics with arena battles, but introduces its own unique elements and challenges.  
Unlike arena fights, which are confined to nine rounds, a boss fight is a relentless battle until death.  
 Players can send one Homunculus at a time to challenge the boss, with the Homunculus continuing to fight as long as it has HP remaining.  
Therefore it is crucial to find a balanced strategy between maximum damage and survival of your Homunculus.  This adds an extra layer of tactical depth to these encounters.

### Loot
The Boss Event includes a specialized leaderboard that displays the highest damage dealers by account. This total damage is a cumulative amount, aggregating the damage dealt by all the Homunculi you own in the event

Higher ranked players in the leaderboard receive better and rarer loot. This encourages you to attack with your Homunculi as often as possible during the uptime of the boss. 

### Cooldown
A boss fight is an exhausting adventure for your Homunculus. This results in a higher resting time for your Homunculus compared to an Arena match. After a Boss fight your Homunculus is on a two hour cooldown. 

### Available Boss Fights
There are various open world bosses available, and their number is continually increasing. Each open world boss is associated with a specific element, which determines the loot you receive
