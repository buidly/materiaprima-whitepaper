# üêâ Homunculi

Every Alchemist is able to create smaller or larger helpers through of transmutation. 

They are called Homunculi.
There are dozens of different types of Homunculi.

But there are not only different types but also each and every one is unique for itself through different traits.

Each and every single one is deliberately designed and drawn with pen on paper before they are digitally remastered to become a NFT. 

As the collection of Homunculi growths we will add more dedicated pages here. 

## Creation and Use
Once a Homunculus has been created, the Homunculus can fulfil different tasks for his master. 
They are the alchemists' best helper. You can send you Homunculi to gather resources for you or command them in battle against your enemies. They are central to the game's mechanics.
