# 🐉 Homunculi

Every Alchemist is able to create smaller or larger helpers through transmutation.  

They are called Homunculi (singular: Homunculus).   
There are hundreds of different types of Homunculi.

Same as the Element Gems, Homunculi also come in three tiers.

With each higher tier the homunculi become more powerful but also require higher tier element gems for transmutation.

But there are not only different types but also each and every one is unique for itself through different traits.

Tier 1 homunculi consist of 3 main traits. 
The body, body parts like eyes, claws, nails etc. and a special trait that is uniquely designed. 
While the body and the body parts only vary in color, the special trait also comes with dedicated designs. 
Special traits can for example be a horn like presented with the Limex Homunculus. 
Through a combination of the traits, each Homunculi has around 2000-2500 unique designs.
Each and every single Homunculus is deliberately designed and drawn with pen on paper before they are digitally remastered to become a NFT.



### Creation and Use
Once a Homunculus has been created, the Homunculus can fulfill different tasks for his master. They are the alchemists' best helper. You can send you Homunculi to gather resources for you **[Gather Run](../Expeditions/Gather Run)** or command them in battle against your enemies (**[Arena](../Arena/About )** or  **[Boss Fights](../Boss/About)**).   
They are central to the game's mechanics.
