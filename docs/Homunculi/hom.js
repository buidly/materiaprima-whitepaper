Once a Homunculus has been created, the Homunculus can fulfil different tasks for his master. 
They are the alchemists' best helper. You can send you Homunculi to gather resources for you or command them in battle against your enemies. They are central to the game's mechanics.

There are dozens of different types of Homunculi. But there are not only different types but also each and every one is unique for itself through different traits.
