# ⛏️ Gather Run


In Alka Sowa, your Homunculi are valuable allies in gathering essential resources. Deploy them on Gather Runs to collect Element Dust which can be combined into Element gems. 
Each type of dust has its special location where it can be found.  
But keep in mind that only Element Dust for the Tier 1 elements can be gathered. Higher tier Element Gems can only be obtained through transmutation.

### Gather Run Options

The game offers you to choose between three different run durations:

**Short Run (1 Hour)**  
This is a quick run which yields highest dust per hour ratio.  
Reward: 2-10 dust (2.85 dust in average)




**Medium Run (3 Hours)**   
This is a balanced option between time and resource collection.  
Reward: 3-15 dust (4.6 dust in average)




**Long Run (12 Hours)**  
Accumulates more resources overall but less per hour.  
Reward: 8-35 dust (11.8 dust in average)

Over the long term, each run option tends to yield the average values mentioned previously. However, individual run results can greatly vary. The maximum reward for a 1-hour run can reach up to 10 dust, for a 3-hour run it's 15 dust, and for a 12-hour run, it can be as high as 35 dust. While these high rewards are rare, they can significantly enhance your overall gain



For an optimal strategy in resource gathering, consider scheduling continuous 1-hour Gather Runs. This approach maximizes the return of Element Dust per hour, making it the most rewarding in terms of efficiency despite being the most demanding in terms of management and attention.

### Gather Run Locations

The five available Gather Run locations are: 

**Luna Decrens (Air)**  
Majestic mountaintops that pierce the clouds, where the atmosphere is thin and the winds carry tales from distant lands. The high altitude makes it a prime location for capturing the essence of the air element.

**Gota Cruor (Fire)**  
It is also called the eternal eye. When it opens, the ground rumbles, the earth quakes and glowing lava pours down its slopes. His flames are believed to be the purest manifestation of the fire element in all of Alka Sowa.

**Gigas Ferreus (Iron)**  
Beings of long-forgotten cultures have driven deep tunnels into the stone. The rocks are drenched with silvery veins and when you strike them, the pure iron in them begins to sing like a thousand choirs.
