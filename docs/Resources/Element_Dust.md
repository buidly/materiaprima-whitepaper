# âœ¨Element Dust

Element dust embodies tiny fragments of the game's pure elements. These fine particles can be skillfully refined by craftsmen into true element gems, harnessing their intrinsic alchemical properties.


Element dust in "Materia Prima" is a fundamental resource that players can gather through the game's "Gather Runs" feature. In the fantasy world of Alka Sowa, element dust represents the most basic form of the five tier one elements: water, earth, air, fire, and iron. Each type of element dust is unique and can be found in specific locations within the game world that are intrinsically tied to the nature of the element itself.  

**Water Dust**:   
Typically found near bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, or oceans. It embodies the fluidity and adaptability of water.

Players send their Homunculi to collect these dusts during **[Gather Runs](../Expeditions/Gather_Run)**, which can last for 1, 3, or 12 hours.  
The longer the Homunculus is out gathering, the more element dust it will collect.   

### Crafting Relevance
This dust plays a crucial role in the game's crafting system, as 1000 units of a single type of element dust can be combined to create a corresponding element gem. 
These gems are more potent and have a wide range of applications in various crafting recipes and magical endeavors within the game.  
The concept of element dust ties into the broader themes of alchemy and elemental magic in "Materia Prima," serving as a foundational resource for players to interact with the world's mystical properties.
