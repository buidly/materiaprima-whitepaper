# ðŸ“œ Runes

Every recipe consists of runes.  
To write down a recipe, you first have to research old tomes and their runes in libraries and antiquarian bookshops. The complexity of a recipe depends on the complexity of its runes. There are three types of complexity levels:  
* Tier 1 recipes consist of 1000 tier 1 runes.
* Tier 2 recipes consist of 1000 tier 2 runes.
* Tier 3 recipes consist of 1000 tier 3 runes.   

Once you have collected 1000 runes of the same tier, you can generate a recipe in the library. 
Runes can be obtained through various activities in Alka Sowa. They can come from a boss fight, a gather run or a transmutation.
