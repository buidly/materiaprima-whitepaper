# âŒ› Time Sand

Time Sand is a valuable resource in Materia Prima that allows you to circumvent cooldown periods.  
Every activity in the game, from sending your Homunculus into the arena to embarking on a gather run, requires time to complete.  
By using Time Sand, you can manipulate time and space to your advantage and reset cooldowns.  
 You can acquire Time Sand through several activities in Alka Sowa, including boss fights, gather runs, or through transmutation
