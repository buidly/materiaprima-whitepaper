# ðŸ”¨ Crafting 

In the world of Materia Prima, the laboratory is the dedicated space for crafting, a place where alchemists engage in their unique craft. Here, crafting takes on a special term, known as **Transmutation**. A process where elements are skillfully combined to create new forms and objects. 

Within the confines of the laboratory, alchemists perform these transmutations, manipulating the elements to bring forth their creations. This process is a mixture of ancient rituals, mythical recipes and scientific precession. 

To perform a transmutation, you need two things:
* A recipe (i.e. for homunculi, equipment or potions) 
* The needed resources (i.e. for a Homunculus it is 2 Element Gems, which are specified by the recipe)

Like the element gems, the recipes are also differentiated by their power.  
* If it is a Tier 1 recipe, Tier 1 Element Gems are required.
* If it is a Tier 2 recipe, Tier 2 Element Gems are required.
* If it is a Tier 3 recipe, Tier 3 Element Gems are required.

In the laboratory, you can select a recipe from your inventory. Then select the corresponding Element Gems  for the recipe. Once you have selected everything, you can transmute the recipe into a homunculus, an equipment or potions. This transformative procedure consumes both the recipe and the gems.
