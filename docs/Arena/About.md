# ℹ️ About


> _Today, I ventured near the famed Arena of Tristigis. The air thick with ancient magic, the grounds echoing tales of Homunculi duels from ages past. The amphitheater's stones, worn and weathered, whisper secrets to those who listen closely. As I stood at its precipice, memories not mine flooded my senses: the clash of elemental forces, the cheers and gasps of spectral crowds, and the triumphant roars of Homunculi victors. Each brick seemed imbued with tales of honor, strategy, and alchemical prowess. There's a weight to this place, a significance that even time hasn't eroded. I must delve deeper into its lore, for the Arena isn't just a battleground; it's a testament to the rich tapestry of our alchemical heritage._

# General

The Arena of Tristigis is a place where players can use their Homunculi for battles. 
In the first version of the arena there are only PvE battles against other Homunculi available. 
As the game development progresses this will be expended to PvP fights.
