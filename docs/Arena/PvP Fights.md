# ⚔️ Fight System

In the realm of **Materia Prima** combat is a dance of strategy and power, where each move you make can tip the scales of battle. Understanding the intricacies of the fight system is crucial for any aspiring alchemist-warrior. Here's a breakdown of the various moves available to you in combat:

Super Attack: This is your powerhouse move, capable of dealing significant damage to your opponent. However, it requires a good amount of action points (AP), so use it wisely.


Standard Attack: This category includes basic moves like Punching, Kicking, and Hitting. These attacks are more AP-efficient and can vary in damage. The damage inflicted depends on your opponent's move, making it a game of prediction and reaction.


Rest: In the heat of battle, Rest is your key to longevity. This move allows you to regenerate AP, which are essential for executing more powerful attacks. While resting, you won't be able to attack, so choose the right moment to catch your breath.


Block: When you sense danger, Block is your shield. This move prevents a portion of the incoming damage from your opponent's attack. It's a strategic tool to mitigate the impact of powerful blows, especially when you're low on AP.



Each move has its strengths and weaknesses, forming a complex web of possibilities. For example, a Super Attack can break through a Block but might be overkill against a resting opponent. Conversely, using Rest at the wrong time could leave you vulnerable to a devastating Super Attack. The key to mastering the fight system in 'Materia Prima' lies in predicting your opponent's moves and choosing your actions wisely. Every battle is a unique puzzle, where your choices determine your path to victory.
