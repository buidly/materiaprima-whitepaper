# ⚔️ Fight System

In the realm of **Materia Prima** combat is a dance of strategy and power, where each move you make can tip the scales of battle. Understanding the intricacies of the fight system is crucial for any aspiring alchemist. 

Arena fights last for a maximum of 9 rounds or until one Homunculus is defeated. Each round you have to choose a strategic move to beat your enemy. 

Here's a breakdown of the various moves available to you in combat:

**Standard Attack**: This category includes the basic moves Punch, Kick, and Hit. These attacks are actioin point (AP) efficient and can vary in damage. The damage inflicted depends on your opponent's move, making it a game of prediction and reaction.

**Super Attack**: This is your powerhouse move, capable of dealing significant damage to your opponent. However, it requires more action points (AP) than a stadard attack. Use it wisely.

**Block**: When you sense danger, Block is your shield. This move prevents a portion of the incoming damage from your opponent's attack. It's a strategic tool to mitigate the impact of powerful blows, especially when you're low on AP.

**Rest**: In the heat of battle, Rest is your key to longevity. This move allows you to regenerate AP, which are essential for executing attacks and blocks. While resting, you are an easy target. So choose the right moment to catch your breath.



Each move has its strengths and weaknesses, forming a complex web of possibilities. A Super Attack can break through a Block but might be overkill against a resting opponent. Conversely, using Rest at the wrong time could leave you vulnerable to a devastating attacks.

### Cooldown System

In 'Materia Prima,' the Arena cooldown feature is designed to depend on the Level and XP (Experience Points) of your Homunculus.  
This mechanic reflects the growing strength and abilities of the Homunculus as it gains experience and levels up.  
Initially, when a Homunculus is at a lower level, the cooldown period for re-entering the Arena is 10 minutes. This allows newer or less experienced players to engage more frequently in Arena battles, facilitating faster learning and progression.

As the Homunculus gains more experience and levels up, the cooldown period increases. This gradual increase in cooldown time corresponds to the enhanced skills and capabilities of a higher-level Homunculus. 

The following table lists the cooldowns in relation to the XP the Homunculus holds:

| Cumulative XP | Cooldown Time (min) |
|---------------|:---------------------------------:|
| 0             | 10                              |
| 50            | 12                              |
| 200           | 14                              |
| 500           | 16                              |
| 1000          | 18                              |
