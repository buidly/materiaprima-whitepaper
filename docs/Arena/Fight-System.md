# ⚔️ Fight System

Each move has its strengths and weaknesses. 
For instance, 'Super' inflicts 25 damage on most actions but is slightly weaker against another 'Super'. 'Defend' and 'Rest' prevent damage. Moves like Punch, Kick, and Hit have variable damages based on the opponent's action.

Choose wisely to beat your enemy.
