In the enchanting realm of Alka Sowa, elemental resources are categorized into three distinct tiers, each varying in value and potency.  
This classification is essential for practitioners of alchemy and those seeking to master the art of elemental transmutation.

**Tier 1 Elements:** These are the foundational elements Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and Iron.  They can be gatherered in the world of Alka Sowa and are readily available across Alka Sowa and form the basis of alchemical practices.   

**Tier 2 Elements:** A step above in rarity and value are Sulfur, Copper, Glass, and Mercury. These elements are not found naturally and must be transmuted from the simple Tier 1 elements. The intricate procedure requires a deep understanding of elemental properties and precise manipulation.  

**Tier 3 Elements:** At the pinnacle of elemental hierarchy stand the most potent elements – Gold, Platinum, and Aqua Regia. The creation of these elements involves a complex transmutation process starting from Tier 2 elements. Mastery over these transmutations is a testament to an alchemist's skill and knowledge.
