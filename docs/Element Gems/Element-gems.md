Tier 1 elements (earth, water, air, fire, iron) can be gathered in the world of Alka Sowa.

Tier 2 and Tier 3 elements are more valuable and must be transmuted from the simple elements.

The elements are divided into three tiers , which differ not only in value, but also in power. 
The following plan shows all elements and their relationship with each other. 
For example, to create a Tier 2 element you need two Tier 1 elements. The diagram shows how the
