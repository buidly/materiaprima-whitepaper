# ðŸª¨ Raw Gems


There is an additional way to obtain Element Gems. 
You can buy Raw Gems at the market. The traders there sell their valuable goods, which they source from suppliers all over the continent. Unfortunately, however, you don't know what element is in a Raw Gem until an alchemist Lapidary has performed his artful craft on it. You can only guess its value by the glint of the raw gems. 


The following Element Gems can be created from a **Tier 1 Raw Gem:**
* Water Gem (20% chance)
* Fire Gem (20% probability)
* Air Gem (20% probability)
* Earth Gem (20% probability)
* Iron Gem (20% probability)


The following Element Gems can be created from a **Tier 2 Raw Gem:**
* Sulfur Gem (25% probability)
* Copper Gem (25% probability)
* Mercury Gem (25% probability)
* Glass Gem (25% probability)

The following Element Gems can be created from a **Tier 3 Raw Gem:  **
* Gold Gem (33.3% probability)
* Platinum Gem (33.3% probability)
* Aqua Regia Gem (33.3% probability)

When you bring these Raw Gems to the Lapidary, he can extract a random Element Gem according to the Tier level of the Raw Gem.
